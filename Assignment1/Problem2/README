Assignment1 Problem2 John Liu
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Run the following command in terminal at the very beginning
    (Assuming the lc3as is already installed in the same folder):
        $ gcc lc3.c -o A1P2
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-trapvec.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-trap.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-process1.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-process2.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-process3.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-process4.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2-process5.asm
        $ ./lc3as 3-2.asm

Run the VM program:
    $ ./A1P2
